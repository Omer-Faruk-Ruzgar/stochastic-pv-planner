# PV Optimization with PyGAD and pandapower

This project optimizes photovoltaic (PV) placement and sizing  on a power distribution network using a genetic algorithm (PyGAD) and simulates grid behavior with pandapower.

## Stucture 

- `main.py`: entry point
- `optimizer/`: core logic for GA and grid simulation
- `requirements.txt`: reproducible environment

## To run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
